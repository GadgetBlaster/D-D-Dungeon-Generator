D&D Generator at dnd-v1.mysticwaffle.com is web application, forged by AJ, a Human Sorcerer, written (mostly) in JavaScript. The app implements a procedural generation algorithm to draw Dungeons & Dragons game maps as SVG graphics using user input.

The application requires zero 3rd party library dependencies. Functionally is validated on load by a custom built unit testing framework.

The project at https://github.com/GadgetBlaster/JavaScript-DnD-Dungeon-Generator is no longer being developed. Checkout the complete rebuild of this dungeon generator at dnd.mysticwaffle.com.

Happy adventuring!
